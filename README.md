## üõ†Ô∏è Proxmox Tweaks

### Disk Performance Optimization
- Enable **writeback caching** on the disks for better performance.
- Set up **ZFS compression** for storage optimization.
  
### Backup and Restore Tweaks
- Use **Proxmox Backup Server** for efficient backups of VMs/CTs.
- Automate backup schedules with **cron jobs** or **Proxmox GUI**.

### Resource Allocation
- Set **CPU and memory limits** for VMs and containers to prevent over-utilization.
- Adjust **IO limits** using the `io` option in the VM/CT config files.

### High Availability Setup
- Ensure **Corosync** is running for HA setup.
- Configure **Proxmox cluster** for automatic failover and load balancing.

## üåê Proxmox SDN (Software Defined Networking)

### Overview of SDN in Proxmox
- **Software Defined Networking (SDN)** allows for more dynamic and scalable networking in Proxmox environments.
- Use **OVS (Open vSwitch)** to provide centralized management and network isolation for containers and VMs.

### Setting Up Proxmox SDN
- Configure **bridge networks** for containers and VMs.
- Set up **VXLAN** or **GRE tunnels** for inter-node communication.

### Network Security
- Create **firewall rules** for isolated networks.
- Integrate Proxmox with **pfSense** or **OPNsense** for advanced firewalling.

### Network Segmentation
- Create **virtual LANs (VLANs)** within Proxmox for isolating network traffic.
- Use **QEMU/KVM networking** options for VMs to control traffic isolation.

### Network Monitoring
- Monitor network traffic using **iftop**, **netstat**, and the **Proxmox GUI**.
- Implement **flow monitoring** for SDN traffic using **ntopng** or **sFlow**.

## üñ•Ô∏è LXC / VM Configurations

### LXC Configurations
- **Memory and CPU allocation** for containers:
  - Allocate sufficient **memory** and **CPU** resources for LXC containers using the Proxmox web GUI or config files.
  - Limit container resource usage to avoid affecting other VMs/CTs on the same node.
  
- **Storage optimization for containers**:
  - Configure **storage volumes** with ZFS or LVM for better disk usage.
  - Consider using **overlayfs** for faster container storage.

### VM Configurations
- **QEMU/KVM optimizations**:
  - Enable **nested virtualization** for VM workloads.
  - Use **virtio drivers** for enhanced network and disk performance.

- **Disk and Storage Optimization**:
  - Set up **LVM**, **ZFS**, or **Ceph** for resilient and scalable storage for VMs and containers.
  - Enable **SSD cache** for high-speed storage.

- **Best Practices**:
  - Configure **start/stop behavior** for better startup and shutdown times of VMs/CTs.
  - Ensure **isolation** using **cgroups** in multi-tenant environments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Helper Scripts

### Container Management
- `helper-scripts/ct/`: Automate tasks for LXC container creation, backups, and migrations.

### Virtual Machine Management
- `helper-scripts/vm/`: Includes scripts for **VM creation**, **snapshotting**, and **migration**.

### Network Tasks
- `helper-scripts/network/`: Useful scripts to manage **network bridges**, **VLANs**, and **IP configurations**.

---

## üìÅ Templates
- `templates/`: Preconfigured **template files** for **container** and **VM** configurations.
  - Includes basic templates for **LXC containers** and **QEMU VMs** with pre-configured **networking**, **storage**, and **security** settings.
